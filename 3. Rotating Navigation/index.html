            <p>
                The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf) is a
                domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae. It is part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial
                carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were
                first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be
                domesticated, and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.

                The Shiba Inu (柴犬) is a Japanese breed of hunting dog. A small-to-medium breed, it is the smallest of the six original and
                distinct spitz breeds of dog native to Japan.

                A small, alert and agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain and hiking trails, the Shiba Inu was originally bred for
                hunting. It looks similar to and is often mistaken for other Japanese dog breeds like the Akita Inu or Hokkaido, but the Shiba Inu is a
                different breed with a distinct blood line, temperament, and smaller size than other Japanese dog breeds.
